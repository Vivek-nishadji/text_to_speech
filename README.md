**Overview**

The Text-to-Speech Conversion Application is a web-based tool that allows users to convert their text into audio. Built with Django as the backend framework, this application leverages text-to-speech (TTS) technologies like pyttsx3 or gTTS to provide a seamless user experience. Users can input text, generate audio files, and play or download the audio output.
